# South-African-Computer-Programming-Olympiad
A repository storing solutions to questions from past South African Computer Programming Olympiad rounds.

The solutions contained here were not necessarily provided by the test organizers, but some ideas were derived from the official solutions.
I intend to develop this over the next couple months in preparation for the Olympiad and also to help others.
